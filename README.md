# TravelsJournal

I have created a CMS to allow a user to record the details of any trips that they have travelled on. They are able to keep track of the destinations they have visited, a summary of their adventures, a rating from 1-5 of how much they enjoyed, as well as the companions that accompanied them that vacation. 

# CRUD capabilities: 
This application allows the user to create, read, update, and delete all data types: namely the destination, rating, and companion details.

# Database:
Tables
There are 3 tables: destinations, ratings, and companions.

Relationships
There is a one to many relationship between the ratings and destinations table, and a many to many relationship between the destinations and companions table. 

Feel free to browse and clone the code!
